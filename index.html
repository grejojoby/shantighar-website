                                    The Congregation of 'Sisters of the Holy Spirit' was founded in Koblenz, Germany on
                                    4th June 1857 by Mother Irmina Hoelscher with the incentive of Fr. Philipp de
                                    Lorenzi. On 7th February 1858 the four pioneers made their commitment and received
                                    religious names as Anna Maria Hoelscher - Sr. Irmina, Mathilde Jesse - Sr.
                                    Anastasia, Anna Hoerter - Sr. Severa, Maria Eichner – Sr. Modesta. Sisters placed
                                    their lives and activities under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. In 1929, the Holy
                                    See raised the congregation to pontifical status during the papacy of Pius IX.
                                    <br><br> In 1862, the congregation extended its activities by admitting battered
                                    women in the
                                    convent house itself, as well as giving free tuition for poor students. They began
                                    to take care of the aged and sick in the new house1 5, Loehrrondell in 1865. In
                                    1866, the first branch of the congregation was opened in Dudweiler / Saar. They
                                    mainly concentrated on the medical apostolate and teaching in industrial schools for
                                    the girls. In 1868 the second branch was opened at Saarbrucken. After the
                                    Kulturkampf (Culture Struggle) of the Government again allowed the sisters to open
                                    new branches and to recruit candidates to the congregation. Mother Elisabeth bought
                                    a plot at Moselweiss to start a hospital, a Novitiate and a home for the aged. In
                                    1887 this centre was inaugurated and named as 'Marienhof.
                                    <br><br> World War II brought destruction and tension to the congregation. In
                                    bombing,
                                    Marienhof convent and church building were completely destroyed. The Mother House
                                    was partially destroyed by fire. 1939 seven convents in Saar were closed down and
                                    sisters fled to unknown faraway places as refugees. The congregation lost all the
                                    documents regarding the foundation and activities of the pioneers because the
                                    archives were burnt down. A great demand was laid on each one to build up the
                                    congregation once again.
                                    <br><br> In 1964 Mother Euthymia and her team decided to extend the mission to India
                                    and
                                    worked hard for its establishment. Hence in 1973 congregation reached in India to
                                    work in Diocese of Chanda and started the first centre at Warur ' Tera Prem' on 21st
                                    January.
                                    <br><br> On 1st September 2008, Sisters of the Holy Spirit launched its mission
                                    activities in
                                    Tanzania.
                                    <br><br> In the year 2017 sisters started to work in America
                                    <br><br><br>

                                    There is a group of Advocates who deals with the legal issue related to these women.
                                    Women are helped to get maintenance for them and for the children from the husband,
                                    or go for mutual consent divorce. They are also helped to get their fair share of
                                    property and to get divorce if the client is convinced of the need for being
                                    separated from the husband. Mediation is another method of assisting legally where a
                                    third person mediates and speaks for both the parties impartially. Finally come to
                                    an opinion which would be acceptable for both the parties.

                                    The number of people attending is increasing every Sunday. As the Al Anon members
                                    begin to understand that Alcoholism is a disease they are able to give as much
                                    empathy and care as they would to a patient of any other sickness.
                                    One day get-together programme is organized every year as birthday of Shantighar AA

                                            Ms. Sarita, born on 16.08.1990 from a well to do family of Jain community in
                                            Mumbai.
                                            She looks beautiful and was studying in the 12th standard. During this
                                            period she
                                            fell in love with a Maharashtrian Hindu, an auto driver and without the
                                            consent of
                                            her parents, she got married to him. Since she married from other caste,
                                            without the
                                            permission of her parents, parents refused to accept her. She gave birth to
                                            a baby
                                            boy namely Veer and now he is 7 years old.

                                            Unfortunately her husband was addicted to drugs and alcohol and thereof they
                                            had a
                                            miserable life. When her father-in-law was alive, they stayed along with him
                                            in the
                                            rental house by his mercy. Subsequent to the death of the father-in-law,
                                            they were
                                            thrown out by the owner due to their financial constraints and non-payment
                                            of the
                                            stipulated amount of rent.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Due to the bad financial conditions they were unable to hire a room and they
                                            started
                                            to live in a damaged auto abandoned on the road side. One day one unknown
                                            person
                                            assaulted her and beaten her up and she became unconscious. A Good Samaritan
                                            passed
                                            by that way and seeing her condition reached her to the nearby govt.
                                            hospital.
                                            Almost four months she was in the hospital. During this time her husband was
                                            killed
                                            by someone and the neighbors cremated him.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Due to the assaults she got severe injuries on the brain and she became
                                            semi-paralyzed and her eyes were damaged. When she was discharged from the
                                            hospital,
                                            she was admitted in a blind institute. After some days the organization
                                            asked her to
                                            leave the place as she was not totally blind, moreover she developed
                                            epilepsy.
                                            Thereafter through one of our benefactor her child was admitted in
                                            Snehasadan and
                                            Sarita was brought to Shantighar.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Sarita was in deep depression and started bad habits and was addicted to
                                            smoking,
                                            pan masala, black tea and mobile. Since she was physically challenged and
                                            due to
                                            depression, she was unable to maintain herself and even the natures call.
                                            When the
                                            In-charge realized the need of special care and treatment, we started to
                                            give proper
                                            care, therapy, counseling, medication, proper food on time to time. In a
                                            short time
                                            she showed improvements and started managing herself and doing her daily
                                            routines.
                                            Even she started reading books and learning English, which was completely
                                            neglected
                                            by her.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The continuous positive strokes and encouragement from the therapist, the
                                            shelter
                                            home and friends, she moved forward with great enthusiasm and took up a job
                                            of
                                            housekeeping and she is working now. She looks at a bright future and
                                            specially
                                            thinking of her son. She decided to be independent, to work and to live
                                            successfully.
                                            Even in this pandemic period, she took a challenge and rented a room and
                                            continued
                                            the work of housekeeping in a company. Shantighar helped her with the needed
                                            arrangements to set up her home with household articles and provisions.

                                            Ms. Manisha aged 34 years along with her 4 year old son, came to Shantighar
                                            seeking for shelter in January 2020 due to domestic violence, mental torture
                                            and physical assault due to adultery. She was thrown out of the house and he
                                            brought one lady and started staying in the house. Through Protection
                                            officer she approached the Hon’ble Court and got an order from the Kalyan
                                            court in her favour, to continue to stay in the matrimonial home. When she
                                            reached along with the protection officer, he threatened them and entry to
                                            the house was blocked. Protection officer also just left her without any
                                            assistance. Then Manisha along with the small child left on the road without
                                            any hope. With one individual’s help she reached to MIDC police station and
                                            from there she was brought to Shantighar.

                                            When she came, she was very complicated in her behaviour, not mingling with
                                            other inmates, suspicious, abusive, no helping hand and isolated. Continuous
                                            counseling and guidance she slowly opened up and started to mingle with
                                            other inmates and staff. Her case was pending in Kalyan court and in Session
                                            court. Due to pandemic matters were not getting forward. Finally with the
                                            help of other friends she took the courage and left the Shantighar on
                                            29.07.2020 and entered her matrimonial home with the help of police. Thus
                                            she got her house back and now living happily.
